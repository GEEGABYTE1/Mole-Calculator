# Basic Chem Calculations made easy in Go 🧪


# Uncertainties ⚖️

Users can find calculate both the absolute and relative uncertainty from their terminal. 

By inputting the data, the program will do the basic computations necessary to compute the uncertainty. 

You can access the files under the directory, *uncertainty_calcs*, with two different files name after either absolute uncertainty, or relative uncertainty calculations.


# Basic Chem Calculations 🧪

Users can find mass percent, mass of a certain compound given moles and molar mass, how many moles are there in a certain amount of atoms or molecules, and percentage composition. 

*Note*: Each program only computes the basic calculations. The user is expected to have relevant data ready to be inputted when using the program. The answer is typically rounded 6 decimal places.

This is a beginner project and is inspired by what I'm currently learning in Chemistry. 

Made in Go with a purpose.
